    "# Fetching Web Page Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a basic understanding of web scraping and the composition of a web page, let's proceed to obtaining the HTML content of a web page. We will use the `requests` library for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, ensure that you installed all the necessary libraries in the `requirements.txt` file. If not, you can install them using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "From here, I will assume that you have installed all the necessary libraries. If you haven't, please do so before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the `requests` library?\n",
    "\n",
    "`requests` is a Python library that allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. It is a very powerful library and is widely used for obtaining web page content. You can find more information about the `requests` library [here](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The `requests` library is very easy to use. You can use it to send HTTP requests to a web server and obtain the response. The response will contain the HTML content of the web page. Here is a simple example of how to use the `requests` library to obtain the HTML content of a web page:"
